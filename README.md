# Audio & Music Manager

## Why videogames use sound?
Sound design and music play an important role in the overall experience of modern videogames. Game audio can help designers to create tension, add emotion, build immersion in the game world.

## Types of audios
* Background Music: Usually a loop sound, used to add interest to diferents moments of the game. Can be very varied, for example epic music in great enemies or relaxing one while player is exploring.
* Dialog Audio: Find when talking with NPC or sometimes listen from the storyteller.
* FX Audio: Sounds effects generated by the enviroment. For example when the player walk through the water a sound is played for a short amount of time. Very usefull to create a more realistic world.
* Foley Audio: Any sound or effect that the player create, is made to give feedback of what are you doing to the player. For example the jump sound.
* Spot Music: Less frequent than others, used to create a sound with an specific origin. The playen can only listen this music if is near the origin. For example and NPC playing a piano.
